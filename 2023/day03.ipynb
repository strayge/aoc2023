       "<p>The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can <em>add up all the part numbers</em> in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.</p>\n",
       "<p>The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently <em>any number adjacent to a symbol</em>, even diagonally, is a \"part number\" and should be included in your sum.

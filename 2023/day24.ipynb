       "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 24: Never Tell Me The Odds ---</h2><p>It seems like something is going wrong with the snow-making process. Instead of forming snow, the water that's been absorbed into the air seems to be forming <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail\" target=\"_blank\">hail</a>!</p>\n",
       "<p>Maybe there's something you can do to break up the hailstones?</p>\n",
       "<p>Due to strong, probably-magical winds, the hailstones are all flying through the air in perfectly linear trajectories. You make a note of each hailstone's <em>position</em> and <em>velocity</em> (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n",
       "<pre><code>19, 13, 30 @ -2,  1, -2\n",
       "18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2\n",
       "20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4\n",
       "12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1\n",
       "20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3\n",
       "</code></pre>\n",
       "<p>Each line of text corresponds to the position and velocity of a single hailstone. The positions indicate where the hailstones are <em>right now</em> (at time <code>0</code>). The velocities are constant and indicate exactly how far each hailstone will move in <em>one nanosecond</em>.</p>\n",
       "<p>Each line of text uses the format <code>px py pz @ vx vy vz</code>. For instance, the hailstone specified by <code>20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3</code> has initial X position <code>20</code>, Y position <code>19</code>, Z position <code>15</code>, X velocity <code>1</code>, Y velocity <code>-5</code>, and Z velocity <code>-3</code>. After one nanosecond, the hailstone would be at <code>21, 14, 12</code>.</p>\n",
       "<p>Perhaps you won't have to do anything. How likely are the hailstones to collide with each other and smash into tiny ice crystals?</p>\n",
       "<p>To estimate this, consider only the X and Y axes; <em>ignore the Z axis</em>. Looking <em>forward in time</em>, how many of the hailstones' <em>paths</em> will intersect within a test area? (The hailstones themselves don't have to collide, just test for intersections between the paths they will trace.)</p>\n",
       "<p>In this example, look for intersections that happen with an X and Y position each at least <code>7</code> and at most <code>27</code>; in your actual data, you'll need to check a much larger test area. Comparing all pairs of hailstones' future paths produces the following results:</p>\n",
